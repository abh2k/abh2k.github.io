Adding unit tests

**1.** There have been several minor optimization been done in this week, like the primes of the factor_base which make `a` have been given a bound of [1000, 5000]. The lower bound ensures
that there are very less redundant relations (<~1%) and the upper bound ensures that with a single `a` we are able to make many polynomials for sieving.

**2.** Another major part of this week works was to implement unit tests for every functions.

**3.** I also performed performance comparision of QS with ECM. QS was ale to factorize a 50 digit number within ~8 mins while ECM took longer than QS to do the same factorization.
