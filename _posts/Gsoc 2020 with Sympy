title: Finally selected for Gsoc!
---

From my first year i always wanted to get selected for Gsoc and do some exiciting projects, but never took it seriously. When i reached  my third year i made up my mind that it is a high time for preparig for Gsoc. For Gsoc 2020 i choose to apply to Sympy as i found this community very intresting. I took a head start and started contributing for four months before the application period. It was a really nice experience and i meet some really interesting people. I am glad that i made the right decision of choosing this organization.

PROJECT:
My project is based on implementing faster factorization algorithms in Sympy. Curently sympy uses exponential time factorization algoritms which strugles to factorize numbers of greater than ~20 digits. I will be implementing Lenstra's Elliptic Curve Factorization and the Self-Initializing Quadratic Sieve. These are sub-exponential time algorithms which can easily factor number of less than 50 digits within seconds.
